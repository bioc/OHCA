Description: The primary aim of this book is to introduce the R user to Hi-C 
    analysis. This book starts with key concepts important for the analysis 
    of chromatin conformation capture and then presents Bioconductor tools that 
    can be leveraged to process, analyze, explore and visualize Hi-C data.
