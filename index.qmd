This is the landing page of the **"Orchestrating Hi-C analysis with Bioconductor"** 
book. **The primary aim of this book is to introduce the `R` user to Hi-C analysis**. It 
starts with key concepts important for the analysis of chromatin conformation capture and then 
presents `Bioconductor` tools that can be leveraged to process, analyze, explore and visualize 
Hi-C data. 

::: {.callout-caution}
This project is currently under active development. Several sections of this book may not be accurate, as the packages introduced in this book are still maturing.

# Requirements {-}

## General audience

This books aims to demonstrate how to pre-process, parse and investigate Hi-C data in `R`. 
For this reason, a significant portion of this book consists of executable R code chunks. 
To be able to reproduce the examples demonstrated in this book and go further in the analysis of 
*your **real** datasets*, you will need to rely on several dependencies. 

- The most important dependency is `R` itself! Make sure you have `R >= 4.3`. You can check that by typing `version` in an R console. If you do not have `R >= 4.3` installed, you will need to update your `R` version, as most extra dependencies 
will require `R >= 4.3`. 

- `Bioconductor >= 3.17` is also required. You can check whether `Bioconductor` is available and its version in `R` by 
typing `BiocManager::version()`. If you do not have `BiocManager` >= 3.17 installed, you will need to update it 
as follows: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.17")
```

- You will also need important packages, which will be described in length in this book. 
The following `R` code will set up most of the extra dependencies: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("HiCExperiment", ask = FALSE)
BiocManager::install("HiCool", ask = FALSE)
BiocManager::install("HiContacts", ask = FALSE)
BiocManager::install("HiContactsData", ask = FALSE)
BiocManager::install("fourDNData", ask = FALSE)
BiocManager::install("DNAZooData", ask = FALSE)
```

## Developers 

For developers or advanced R users, the `devel` versions of these packages 
can be installed along with their dependencies: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pak", repos = "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/devel/")
pak::pkg_install("js2264/HiCExperiment", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pak::pkg_install("js2264/HiCool", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pak::pkg_install("js2264/HiContacts", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pak::pkg_install("js2264/HiContactsData", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pak::pkg_install("js2264/fourDNData", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pak::pkg_install("js2264/DNAZooData", ask = FALSE, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
```

## Docker image

If you have `docker` installed, the easiest approach would be to run the following command in a `shell` terminal:

```{sh eval = FALSE}
docker run -it ghcr.io/js2264/ohca:latest R
```

This will fetch a `docker` image with the latest development versions of the 
aforementioned packages pre-installed, and initiate an interactive R session. 

# Reproducibility {-}

## Building book {-}

The OHCA book has been rendered in R thanks to a number of packages, including but not only: 

- `devtools`
- `quarto`
- `rebook`

To build this book locally, you can run: 

```{sh eval = FALSE, filename="bash"}
git clone git@github.com:js2264/OHCA.git && cd OHCA
quarto render
```

::: {.callout-warning}
All dependencies listed above will be required!

In addition, the actual book rendering is done by GitHub Actions, and the 
rendered static website is hosted by GitHub Pages.

```{r echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
library("HiCExperiment")
library("HiCool")
library("HiContacts")
library("HiContactsData")
library("fourDNData")

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
