This is the landing page of the **"Orchestrating Hi-C analysis with Bioconductor"** 
book. The primary aim of this book is to introduce the `R` user to Hi-C analysis. It 
starts with key concepts important for the analysis of chromatin conformation capture and then 
presents `Bioconductor` tools that can be leveraged to process, analyse, explore and visualize 
Hi-C data.

- [Chapter 3: Parsing and manipulating Hi-C data in R](parsing.qmd)
- [Chapter 4: Hi-C data visualization](visualization.qmd)


**Part II: In-depth Hi-C analysis**

- [Chapter 5: Performing Hi-C arithmetics](arithmetics.qmd)
- [Chapter 6: Computing Hi-C important metrics](metrics.qmd)
- [Chapter 7: Finding topological features from a Hi-C contact matrix](topological-features.qmd)
