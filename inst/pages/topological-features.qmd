## Aims
This chapter focuses on the annotation of topological features from Hi-C contact 
maps, including: 

- Chromosome compartments 
- Topologically associating domains
- Stable chromatin loops

:::

## Chromosome compartments 

Chromosome compartments refer to the segregation of the chromatin 
into active euchromatin (A compartments) and regulated heterochromatin 
(B compartment).

### Importing Hi-C data

To investigate chromosome compartments, we will fetch a contact matrix generated 
from a micro-C experiment (from @Krietenstein_2020). A subset of the genome-wide
dataset is provided in the `HiContactsData` package. It contains intra-chromosomal 
interactions within `chr17`, binned at `5000`, `100000` and `250000` bp. 

```{r}
library(HiCExperiment)
library(HiContactsData)
cf <- CoolFile(HiContactsData('microC', 'mcool'))
microC <- import(cf, resolution = 250000)
microC

seqinfo(microC)
```

### Annotating A/B compartments

The consensus approach to annotate A/B compartments is to compute the 
eigenvectors of a Hi-C contact matrix and identify the eigenvector representing 
the chromosome-wide bi-partite segmentation of the genome. 

The `getCompartments()` function performs several internal operations to achieve this:

1. Obtains cis interactions per chromosome
2. Computes O/E contact matrix scores
3. Computes 3 first eigenvectors of this Hi-C contact matrix 
4. Normalizes eigenvectors
5. Picks the eigenvector that has the greatest absolute correlation with a phasing track (e.g. a GC% track automatically computed from a genome reference sequence, or a gene density track)
6. Signs this eigenvector so that positive values represent the A compartment

```{r}
phasing_track <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38::BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38
microC_compts <- getCompartments(microC, genome = phasing_track)

microC_compts
```

`getCompartments()` is an endomorphism: it returns the original object, enriched with 
two new pieces of information: 

- A `compartments` `topologicalFeatures`:

```{r}
topologicalFeatures(microC_compts, "compartments")
```

- The calculated eigenvectors stored in `metadata`:

```{r}
metadata(microC_compts)$eigens
```

### Exporting compartment tracks

To save the eigenvector (as a `bigwig` file) and the compartments(as a `gff` 
file), the `export` function can be used: 

```{r}
library(GenomicRanges)
library(rtracklayer)
coverage(metadata(microC_compts)$eigens, weight = 'eigen') |> export('microC_eigen.bw')
topologicalFeatures(microC_compts, "compartments") |> export('microC_compartments.gff3')
```

### Visualizing compartment tracks

Compartment tracks should be visualized in a dedicated genome browser, with the 
phasing track loaded as well, to ensure they are phased accordingly.  
That being said, it is possible to visualize a genome track in R besides the 
matching Hi-C contact matrix. 

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 1
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
microC <- autocorrelate(microC)
p1 <- plotMatrix(microC, use.scores = 'autocorrelated', scale = 'linear', limits = c(-1, 1), caption = FALSE)
eigen <- coverage(metadata(microC_compts)$eigens, weight = 'eigen')[[1]]
eigen_df <- tibble(pos = cumsum(runLength(eigen)), eigen = runValue(eigen))
p2 <- ggplot(eigen_df, aes(x = pos, y = eigen)) + 
    geom_area() + 
    theme_void() + 
    coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Genomic position", y = "Eigenvector value")
wrap_plots(p1, p2, ncol = 1, heights = c(10, 1))
```

Here, we clearly note the concordance between the Hi-C correlation matrix, highlighting 
correlated interactions between pairs of genomic segments, and the eigenvector 
representing chromosome segmentation into 2 compartments: A (for positive values)
and B (for negative values). 

### Saddle plots

Saddle plots are typically used to measure the `observed` vs. `expected` 
interaction scores within or between genomic loci belonging to A and B 
compartments. 

Non-overlapping genomic windows are grouped in `nbins` quantiles 
(typically between 10 and 50 quantiles) according to their A/B compartment 
eigenvector value, from lowest eigenvector values (i.e. strongest B 
compartments) to highest eigenvector values (i.e. strongest A compartments). 
The average `observed` vs. `expected` interaction scores are then computed for 
pairwise eigenvector quantiles and plotted in a 2D heatmap. 

```{r}
library(BiocParallel)
plotSaddle(microC_compts, nbins = 25, BPPARAM = SerialParam(progressbar = FALSE))
```

Here, the top-left small corner represents average O/E scores between strong B 
compartments and the bottom-right larger corner represents average O/E scores 
between strong A compartments. Note that only `chr17` interactions are contained in this dataset, explaining the grainy 
aspect of the saddle plot. 

## Topological domains

Topological *domains* (a.k.a. Topologically Associating Domains, TADs, isolated neighborhoods, contact domains, ...) refer to local chromosomal segments (e.b. roughly â‰¤ 1Mb in mammal genomes)
which preferentially self-interact, in a constrained manner.  They are demarcated by 
domain *boundaries*. 

![](images/20230403090000.png){width=40%, fig-align="center"}

They are generally conserved across cell types and species (@Schmitt_2016), typically 
correlate with units of DNA replication (@Pope_2014), and could play 
a role during development (@Stadhouders_2019). 

### Computing diamond insulation score

Several approaches exist to annotate topological domains (@Sefer_2022). Several packages in R implement some of these functionalities, e.g. `spectralTAD` or `TADcompare`. 

`HiContacts` offers a simple `getDiamondInsulation` function which computes the 
diamond insulation score (@Crane_2015). This score quantifies average interaction 
frequency in an insulation window (of a certain `window_size`) sliding along 
contact matrices at a chosen `resolution`. 

```{r}
# - Compute insulation score
bpparam <- SerialParam(progressbar = FALSE)
hic <- zoom(microC, 5000) |> 
    refocus('chr17:60000001-83257441') |>
    getDiamondInsulation(window_size = 100000, BPPARAM = bpparam) |> 
    getBorders()

hic
```

`getDiamondInsulation()` is an endomorphism: it returns the original object, enriched with 
two new pieces of information: 

- A `borders` `topologicalFeatures`:

```{r}
topologicalFeatures(hic, "borders")
```

- The calculated `insulation` scores stored in `metadata`:

```{r}
metadata(hic)$insulation
```

::: {.callout-note}

#### Note

The `getDiamondInsulation` function can be parallelized over multiple 
threads by specifying the Bioconductor generic `BPPARAM` argument. 

:::

### Exporting insulation scores tracks

To save the diamond insulation scores (as a `bigwig` file) and the borders (as a `bed` 
file), the `export` function can be used: 

```{r}
coverage(metadata(hic)$insulation, weight = 'insulation') |> export('microC_insulation.bw')
topologicalFeatures(hic, "borders") |> export('microC_borders.bed')
```

### Visualizing chromatin domains

Insulation tracks should be visualized in a dedicated genome browser.  
That being said, it is possible to visualize a genome track in R besides the 
matching Hi-C contact matrix. 

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 1
hic <- zoom(hic, 100000)
p1 <- plotMatrix(
    hic, 
    use.scores = 'balanced', 
    limits = c(-3.5, -1),
    borders = topologicalFeatures(hic, "borders"),
    caption = FALSE
)
insulation <- coverage(metadata(hic)$insulation, weight = 'insulation')[[1]]
insulation_df <- tibble(pos = cumsum(runLength(insulation)), insulation = runValue(insulation))
p2 <- ggplot(insulation_df, aes(x = pos, y = insulation)) + 
    geom_area() + 
    theme_void() + 
    coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Genomic position", y = "Diamond insulation score")
wrap_plots(p1, p2, ncol = 1, heights = c(10, 1))
```

Local minima in the diamond insulation score displayed below the Hi-C contact 
matrix are identified using the `getBorders()` function, which automatically estimates 
a minimum threshold. These local minima correspond to borders and are visually 
depicted on the Hi-C map by blue diamonds. 

## Chromatin loops 

### `chromosight`

Chromatin loops, dots, or contacts, refer to a strong increase of interaction frequency 
between a pair of two genomic loci. They correspond to focal "dots" on a Hi-C map. 
Relying on computer vision algorithms, `chromosight` uses this property to 
annotate chromatin loops in a Hi-C map (@Matthey_Doret_2020). `chromosight` is 
a standalone `python` package and is made available in R through the `HiCool`-managed 
conda environment with the `getLoops()` function. 

::: {.callout-important icon='true'}

##### Important note: 

`HiCool` relies on `basilisk` R package to set up an underlying, 
self-managed `python` environment. Packages from this environment, including `chromosight`,
are not yet available for ARM chips (e.g. M1/2/3 in newer on macbooks) 
or Windows. For this reason, `HiCool`-supported features are not available 
on these machines. 

:::

#### Identifying loops

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Due to HiCool limitations when rendering the book, this code is not executed here
hic <- HiCool::getLoops(microC, resolution = 5000)
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
## Instead we load pre-computed data from a backed-up object
hic_rds <- system.file('extdata', 'microC_with-loops.rds', package = 'OHCA')
hic <- readRDS(hic_rds)
```

```{r}
hic
```

`getLoops()` is an endomorphism: it returns the original object, enriched with 
two new pieces of information: 

- A `loops` `topologicalFeatures`:

```{r}
topologicalFeatures(hic, "loops")
```

- The arguments used by `chromosight`, stored in `metadata`:

```{r}
metadata(hic)$chromosight_args
```

#### Importing loops from files 

If you are using `chromosight` directly from the terminal (i.e. outside `R`), 
you can import the annotated loops in `R` as follows: 

```{r}
## Change the `.tsv` file to the local output file from chromosight
df <- readr::read_tsv(system.file('extdata', 'chromo.tsv', package = 'OHCA')) 
loops <- InteractionSet::GInteractions(
    anchor1 = GenomicRanges::GRanges(
        df$chrom1, IRanges::IRanges(df$start1, df$end1)
    ),
    anchor2 = GenomicRanges::GRanges(
        df$chrom2, IRanges::IRanges(df$start2, df$end2)
    ),
    bin_id1 = df$bin1, 
    bin_id2 = df$bin2, 
    score = df$score, 
    pvalue = df$pvalue, 
    qvalue = df$qvalue
)

loops
```

#### Exporting chromatin loops

```{r}
loops <- topologicalFeatures(hic, "loops")
loops <- loops[loops$score >= 0.4 & loops$qvalue <= 1e-6]
GenomicInteractions::export.bedpe(loops, 'loops.bedpe')
```

#### Visualizing chromatin loops

```{r}
p <- plotMatrix(
    refocus(hic, 'chr17:62500001-63500000') |> zoom(5000), 
    loops = loops,
    limits = c(-4, -1.2),
    caption = FALSE
)
```

### Other R packages

A number of other R packages have been developed to identify focal chromatin loops, 
notably `fitHiC` (@Ay_2014), `GOTHiC` (@Mifsud_2017) or `idr2d` (@Krismer_2020). 
Each fits a slightly different purpose, and we encourage the end user to read
companion publications.
