# Preamble {-}

Hi-C is an experimental method to quantify spatial interactions between any pair of genomic loci. While a number of command-line interfaces (CLI) exist to process and manipulate Hi-C data (e.g. `cooler` (@Abdennur2020Jan), `juicer` (@Durand2016Jul) and HiC-Pro (@Servant2015Dec)), they generally suffer from several limitations often found in emerging genomics techniques: 

- **No genomic representation of Hi-C processed data**: the existing CLIs can efficiently parse Hi-C data as a numerical matrix and perform a few standard quantitative operations (e.g. contact matrix binning and normalization, dimensionality reduction, etc). However, they systematically fail to **represent a Hi-C contact matrix as a genomic object**. Qualitative analyses (e.g. intersecting chromatin loops with genomic features, finding genes overlapping with domains, etc) therefore remain extremely tedious. 
- **No format-agnostic analysis libraries**. Three competing file format standards (`.(m)cool`, `.hic` and `HiC-Pro` files) currently exist to store Hi-C processed data and dedicated CLIs propose sets of tools specifically working with their corresponding Hi-C processed data file format. This has curbed the development of generic Hi-C data analysis libraries by favoring the emergence of several redundant tools. 
- **Lack of integration within a biology-oriented community**. While rapid development of Hi-C analysis methodology is ongoing, it is primarily driven by small-scale teams rather than by a community as a whole. This oriented development is less likely to fulfill the needs met by other investigators.

In this book, we provide an **overview of a set of tools that enable processing, visualization and in-depth investigation of Hi-C data in R, ensuring intuitive integration of Hi-C data in the existing Bioconductor ecosystem**. We introduce a high-level `HiCExperiment` data structure to represent Hi-C data, directly extending robust, pre-existing core genomic classes offered by `Bioconductor`. This guarantees a stable and intuitive Hi-C data representation in R as a genomic entity, which is highly interoperable and can be used by all existing analysis packages in R.

On top of the `HiCExperiment` data structure, the `HiContacts` package offers extended functionalities to perform matrix-centric and interaction-centric analysis directly on `HiCExperiment` objects and provides powerful visualization tools specifically designed for Hi-C data to facilitate exploratory data analysis. In addition, the `HiCool` package implements a processing workflow based on a lightweight library to process raw Hi-C data into binned Hi-C contact matrices ready to be imported as `HiCExperiment` objects. Finally, the `fourDNData` and `DNAZooData` packages offer a gateway to major public data repositories directly in R.
